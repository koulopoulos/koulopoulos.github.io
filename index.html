            <h1>An <span class="faded">in</span>accessible web.</h1>
            <p class="dropcap">
                Web applications have changed the way we live, work, and play.
                Facebook, Spotify, Netflix, Google Docs, Twitter, Slack, Wordle, 
                The Wall Street Journal — what we have historically viewed as 
                websites are now fully fledged applications leveraging the web 
                as their platform. And as a result, we've come to expect universal 
                and instantaneous access to the products and services existing 
                in this ecosystem. However, the web is not universally <i>accessible</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web accessibility is the practice of designing and developing content 
                for the web in a manner which is accessible to people with disabilities<sup>1</sup>.
                In the same way you would expect physical accommodations such as a wheelchair 
                access ramp for a building, you should expect digital accommodations for the 
                web applications you use. 
                For example, individuals with visual impairments might leverage screen 
                reader software to get an auditory understanding of the content on their 
                display. VoiceOver is Apple's proprietary screen reader included on their
                computers<sup>2</sup>. Close your eyes and take a minute to listen to the following 
                VoiceOver recording.
            </p>
            <audio controls name="voiceover">
                <source src="./voiceover.mp3?raw=true" type="audio/mpeg">
                Your browser does not support this audio player.
            </audio>
            <p>
                Were you unable to create a mental model of the web application being analyzed?
                Was it difficult to follow the position of the reader across the model you imagined?
                Did you get confused by any redundant or repetitive information? If you answered yes
                to any or all of the previous questions, you aren't alone. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Although using a screen reader is something that comes with practice, the software 
                is only as useful as the underlying structure of the web content that guides it.
                It's ultimately the responsibility of software engineers to ensure that web applications  
                are built in a manner that is understandable by assistive software. As web application 
                development becomes increasingly more complex, it becomes harder to consider and address 
                these types of accessibility concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users who don't necessarily need assistive software can still be impacted by the design 
                of application interfaces. Consider the following two versions of the same component 
                (in web application development, a <i>component</i> is a reusable piece of the user interface),
            </p>
            <div class="flex-between">
                <div class="card">
                    <span class="card__label">High contrast (15:1)</span>
                    <span class="card__title">Catch of the Day</span>
                    <span class="card__header">Flounder</span>
                    <span class="card__subtitle">lemon truffle risotto, fire-roasted asparagus</span>
                    <span class="card__footer">—</span>
                </div>
                <div class="card card--inaccessible">
                    <span class="card__label">Low contrast (1.5:1)</span>
                    <span class="card__title">Catch of the Day</span>
                    <span class="card__header">Flounder</span>
                    <span class="card__subtitle">lemon truffle risotto, fire-roasted asparagus</span>
                    <span class="card__footer">—</span>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                One version is clearly easier to read thanks to a higher contrast ratio between 
                the foreground and background colors — something you probably noticed even if you 
                don't have a visual impairment. This highlights an important aspect of accessible 
                design: it's also user-friendly design.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's worth noting that the effects of inaccessible design can extend beyond hindered 
                usability. As web accessibility is partially covered by the Americans with Disabilities 
                Act (ADA)<sup>3</sup>, some businesses might find themselves financially liable for any damages caused 
                by inaccessible design. According to data gathered by international law firm Seyfarth Shaw LLP,
                Lawsuits relating to web accessibility were filed at an all-time high in 2022<sup>4</sup>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As web application interfaces, and the methods developers leverage to create them, are 
                only expected to grow in complexity over time, it's likely that the legal consequences 
                of inaccessible design will continue to be a concern.
            </p>
            <p class="dropcap">
                So, what are web application developers doing to combat accessibility issues?
                One of the most popular trends is to automate the typically manual process of inspecting or auditing code for accessibility issues. 
                For example, an engineer might leverage what is known as a 
                static code analysis tool (also known as a linter) to scan their code for accessibility 
                violations. Despite the implementation details of this process being highly technical, 
                it operates in an incredibly similar manner to a spell checker you would 
                    <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #ff0000;padding:1px"><span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #ff0000;">encountr</span></span>
                in a program like Microsoft Word (yes that typo was intentional). 
                The tool will review code that the engineer has written and provide a warning anywhere it suspects an accessibility violation being introduced.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, when it comes to auditing code for accessibility issues, automated checks cannot be 
                solely relied upon. You've probably encountered a time where a spell checker incorrectly 
                highlighted your writing as an error; This can also occur with static code analysis tools.
                False positives can be a significant hindrance to the development experience, consuming
                time and resources without reason. Alternatively, automated analysis can't detect every true 
                violation. Just as how a spell checker can't detect an incorrect grammatical structure to 
                your writing, a static code analysis tool might not be able to interpret code that is 
                rendered as an inaccessible user interface component.
            </p>
            <p class="dropcap">
                Because the nature of the problem is intrinsically human it's extremely difficult to validate 
                the accessibility of web applications using exclusively automated processes. Although tools such 
                as code linters are a great support system for software engineers, the best way to ensure web 
                accessibility standards are met is spreading awareness. Not only should developers be fully aware 
                of potential violations but users should also take action to report issues they encounter. Ideally,
                this will drive application publishers to raise awareness internally regarding web accessibility and 
                lead to dedicated internal processes focused on maintaining standards.
