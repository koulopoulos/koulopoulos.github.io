            <h1>An <span class="faded">in</span>accessible web.</h1>
            <p>
                Web applications have changed the way we live, work, and play.
                Facebook, Spotify, Netflix, Google Docs, Twitter, Slack, Wordle, 
                The Wall Street Journal — what we have historically viewed as 
                websites are now fully fledged applications leveraging the web 
                as their platform. And as a result, we've come to expect universal 
                and instantaneous access to the products and services existing 
                in this ecosystem. However, the web is not universally <i>accessible</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web accessibility is the practice of designing and developing content 
                for the web in a manner which is accessible to people with disabilities.
                In the same way you would expect physical accommodations such as a wheelchair 
                access ramp for a building, you should expect digital accommodations for the 
                web applications you use. 
                For example, individuals with visual impairments might leverage screen 
                reader software to get an auditory understanding of the content on their 
                display. VoiceOver is Apple's proprietary screen reader included on their
                computers. Close your eyes and take a minute to listen to the following 
                VoiceOver recording.
            </p>
            <audio controls name="voiceover">
                <source src="voiceover.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
            </audio>
            <p>
                Were you unable to create a mental model of the web application being analyzed?
                Was it difficult to follow the position of the reader across the model you imagined?
                Did you get confused by any redundant or repetitive information? If you answered yes
                to any or all of the previous questions, you aren't alone. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Although using a screen reader is something that comes with practice, the software 
                is only as useful as the underlying structure of the web content that guides it.
                It's ultimately the responsibility of software engineers to ensure that web applications  
                are built in a manner that is understandable by assistive software. As web application 
                development becomes increasingly more complex, it becomes harder to consider and address 
                these types of accessibility concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users who don't necessarily need assistive software can still be impacted by the design 
                of application interfaces. Consider the following two versions of the same component 
                (in web application development, a <i>component</i> is a reusable piece of the user interface),
            </p>
            <div class="flex-between">
                <div class="card">
                    <span class="card__label">High contrast (15:1)</span>
                    <span class="card__title">Catch of the Day</span>
                    <span class="card__header">Flounder</span>
                    <span class="card__subtitle">lemon truffle risotto, fire-roasted asparagus</span>
                    <span class="card__footer">—</span>
                </div>
                <div class="card card--inaccessible">
                    <span class="card__label">Low contrast (1.5:1)</span>
                    <span class="card__title">Catch of the Day</span>
                    <span class="card__header">Flounder</span>
                    <span class="card__subtitle">lemon truffle risotto, fire-roasted asparagus</span>
                    <span class="card__footer">—</span>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                One version is clearly easier to read thanks to a higher contrast ratio between 
                the foreground and background colors — something you probably noticed even if you 
                don't have a visual impairment. This highlights an important aspect of accessible 
                design: it's also user-friendly design.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's worth noting that the effects of inaccessible design can extend beyond hindered 
                usability. As web accessibility is partially covered by the Americans with Disabilities 
                Act (ADA), some businesses might find themselves financially liable for any damages caused 
                by inaccessible design. According to data gathered by international law firm Seyfarth Shaw LLP,
                Lawsuits relating to web accessibility were filed at an all-time high in 2022.

            <p>
                As web application interfaces, and the methods developers leverage to create them, are 
                only expected to grow in complexity over time, it's likely that the legal consequences 
                of inaccessible design will continue to be a concern.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what are web application developers doing to combat accessibility issues?
                One of the most popular trends is to automate the process of auditing code for 
                accessibility issues.
